# Transfer-Learning-for-Oral-Cancer-Detection-using-Microscopic-Images
Worked with doctors at a hospital in Pune to collect one of the first datasets of microscopic images for oral cancer detection.
Applied current state-of-the-art models of transfer learning for image classification.
Participated in the NeurIPS Machine Learning For Health Workshop 2020.
